# disease_spreading_model
This is the final project of MATH-UA 251: Intro to Math Modeling taught by K. Shafer Smith. He is a really nice professor, and it is a pleasure to take his class and talk with him.

I have also uploaded the code to play with for this project.

And the file "Aosta_Italy.txt" is the data to use in the first part of this project.
